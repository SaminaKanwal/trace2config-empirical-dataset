**Trace2Config Empirical Dataset**
This repository contains structured empirical traces used to support
trace-driven configuration synthesis and formal verification
of security-enabled automotive product lines.

## Data Availability

The dataset is publicly available under CC BY 4.0.
It contains structured empirical traces derived from controlled
automotive CAN communication experiments and replay injection scenarios.
No proprietary vehicle data is included.

## Reproducibility

All traces are structured CSV files.
Time units are in milliseconds.
Decimal separator: period.
Encoding: UTF-8.

## Intended Use

The dataset is intended for:

- Empirical timing admissibility derivation
- Security configuration benchmarking
- SMT-based configuration pruning
- Formal verification experiments
